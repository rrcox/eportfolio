      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted an app that would do something, but you could
         never find one that fit your needs? Are you looking for someone to
         join your team with the skills and ideas that will add value from
         day one? Let me show you what I can do with a website that acts as
         both a promotion for my consulting business and as an online resume.
         I have developed several mobile and web applications that are
         market-ready or will be shortly. In addition, I can create custom
         applications. The website will serve as the hub for those products,
         an opportunity for potential customers to have a custom app built,
         or a potential employer to view what I can do. What can I help you
         with?
      </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>There are several target audiences for this site. Customers looking
         for custom app development, customers looking for information on
         commercial apps with links to download and purchase them, and
         potential employers who can view a working resume. The site will
         have an appealing design that will display professionalism and
         attention to detail. This will instill confidence in those visiting
         the site that the highlighted products will have been crafted with
         the same skill and care. If new development is required, then
         potential clients will feel that they have come to the right place.
         Likewise, potential employers will get a real-world  assessment of
         current skills and capabilities.</p>

        Dimensional Analyzer        
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you work in the real world as student, engineer, scientist, or in countless other jobs and professions you need a tool that does just math problems but a tool that works with real things. You need a calculator on steroids. Imagine needing to calculate the size of a cistern need to cache rainwater from a roof  of a house you are building. You need to capture 10,000 gallons a year. It rains 23 inches a year in your location. How large should your roof be in square feet? You are imagining the calculation right now - convert the gallons to cubic feet and the inches to feet and then do some math and … How about entering 10000 gal / 23 in and tapping the answer key, 697 sq ft pops up on the display. Rounding is based on NIST guidelines. Tap the number and it toggles to SI units. Tap another key and you can see the step by step dimensional analysis the Dimensional Analyzer performed. The patent- pending technology driving this tool allows you to spot errors in complex calculations using any unit. You can create complex custom formula templates and recall them for later use with a single tap. Everything is designed to be efficient – all major functionality is no more than two taps away, no scrolling, no swiping. The interface is designed to be fast, efficient, and intuitive. This app runs on Android phones and iPhones and supports all popular browsers. This app was built with React Native.
