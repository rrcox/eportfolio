              When you work in the real world as student, engineer, scientist, or in countless other jobs and professions 
              you need a tool that does just math problems but a tool that works with real things. You need a calculator 
              on steroids. Imagine needing to calculate the size of a cistern need to cache rainwater from a roof  of a h
              ouse you are building. You need to capture 10,000 gallons a year. It rains 23 inches a year in your location. 
              How large should your roof be in square feet? You are imagining the calculation right now - convert the 
              gallons to cubic feet and the inches to feet and then do some math and … How about entering 10000 gal / 23 in 
              and tapping the answer key, 697 sq ft pops up on the display. Rounding is based on NIST guidelines. Tap the 
              number and it toggles to SI units. Tap another key and you can see the step by step dimensional analysis the 
              Dimensional Analyzer performed. The patent- pending technology driving this tool allows you to spot errors in 
              complex calculations using any unit. You can create complex custom formula templates and recall them for later 
              use with a single tap. Everything is designed to be efficient – all major functionality is no more than two 
              taps away, no scrolling, no swiping. The interface is designed to be fast, efficient, and intuitive. This app 
              runs on Android phones and iPhones and supports all popular browsers. This app was built with React Native.
