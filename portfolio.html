              When you work in the real world as a student, engineer, scientist,
              or in countless other jobs and professions you need a tool that
              not only solves math problems but a tool that works with real
              things. You need a calculator on steroids. Imagine needing to
              calculate the size of a cistern need to cache rainwater from a
              roof of a house you are building. You need to capture 10,000
              gallons a year. It rains 23 inches a year in your location. How
              large should your roof be in square feet? You are imagining the
              calculation right now - convert the gallons to cubic feet and the
              inches to feet and then do some math and … How about entering
              <span class="display">10000 gal / 23 in</span> and tapping the
              answer key and <span class="display">697 sq ft </span>pops up on
              the display? Rounding is based on NIST guidelines. Tap the number
              and it toggles to SI units. Tap another key and you can see
              step-by-step dimensional analysis. The patent-pending technology
              driving this tool allows you to spot errors in complex
              calculations using any real world unit. You can create complex
              custom formula templates and recall them for later use with a
              single tap. Everything is designed to be efficient – all major
              functionality is no more than two taps away, no scrolling, no
              swiping. The interface is designed to be fast, efficient, and
              intuitive. This app was built with React Native and runs on
              Android phones, iPhones, and browsers.
